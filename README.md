# BANKING-NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE

üîê Secure & Scalable Network Architecture for Banking Systems
This project presents a comprehensive, secure, and scalable network architecture designed specifically for a modern banking environment. It features a centralized main branch connected to three sub-branches, emphasizing high availability, robust security, and seamless inter-branch communication.

üè¢ Main Branch
The main branch functions as the central hub of the network. It houses the primary data center, core banking applications, and centralized databases that manage:

Customer information

Transaction records

Financial operations

To ensure performance and resilience, the main branch is equipped with:

High-speed fiber-optic connections to sub-branches

Redundant firewalls and load balancers

Secure VPN tunnels for encrypted remote access

Centralized access controls and monitoring systems

üè¨ Sub-Branches
Each sub-branch operates independently for day-to-day operations but is tightly integrated with the main branch. Key features include:

VPN connectivity for secure, encrypted communication

Local servers for processing customer accounts and transactions

Daily backups synchronized with the main branch

Redundant network links to ensure uninterrupted service

This setup allows sub-branches to maintain operations even in case of temporary disconnection from the main hub.

üîê Security Architecture
Security is at the core of this network design. The following measures are implemented to protect data and infrastructure:

AES-256 encryption for all communications and stored data

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for real-time threat monitoring

Comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including off-site backups and failover systems

üìà Scalability & Flexibility
This architecture is designed with future growth in mind. It supports:

Easy onboarding of new branches or remote offices

Integration of additional services or platforms (e.g., mobile banking, ATMs)

Cloud or hybrid deployments for enhanced flexibility

Scalable resource allocation without affecting operational efficiency

üí° Use Cases
Enterprise banking network design

Cybersecurity architecture demonstrations

Academic projects on secure infrastructure

Simulation of scalable and secure financial systems
